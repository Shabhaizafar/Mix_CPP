1. Dynamic Array Processing:-
---------------------------
A program allows the user to create an array dynamically. After the array is created, use a for loop to perform operations like summing elements, finding the maximum value, or displaying all elements. Use a do-while loop to allow the user to repeat the process with a new array.
